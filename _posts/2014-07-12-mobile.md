This post was composed and published, entirely from mobile using a couple of iOS apps for managing assets with S3 and deployment to GitHub Pages. Lots of work to do but it'll get there!

At the moment, AirFile is being used to add images to S3 which are then link-pasted into Octopage for publishing. The problem is lack of bucket location selection so links need manual tweaking.
