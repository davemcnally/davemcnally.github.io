This is just a temporary post to test functionality and styles. This will be removed once everything has been styled as required and all functions correctly.

1. This is the initial list item.
2. Here’s a second item in the list.
3. Why not, a third item here.

With the ordered list covered, let’s try something a little more unruly.

- I hyphened these items.
- Just because I could.
- But a plus or asterisk would do too.

Let’s see how some code will look now when written using various options such as line numbers and different languages so we can make sure it covers our needs. I’m using redcarpet for this which now supports some nice features of GFM and Highlight.js for syntax highlighting. This means we can do `<a href="#">link</a>` and `body { background: blue; }` as well as fenced code blocks.

```
body {
    background-color: #0C3D68;
    font-size: 16px;
    font-size: 1.6rem;
    line-height: 1.5;
}
```
