My very first French carp! Caught from Peg 1 at Angel Lakes, fishing directly across to the opposite bank with a single Cell bottom bait. This was the last night of my first trip and I moved around into Peg 1 after not getting a single bite elsewhere on the lake. A reminder to move onto the fish whenever you can â€” I would have gone home with a blank otherwise!
