In an attempt to elaborate on the 140 character announcements, I’m writing up this post with the hopes of finding some new clients and projects that are more in line with the kinds of work I usually do.

My typical projects are small and run from just a week to about a month. I’m not opposed to working on larger things but I like the turnaround of smaller projects and it allows me to work on a variety of things within a small space of time. The downside of this of course, is the need to keep several small bookings in advanced to not run out of work — something I’ve never been great at.

For the work itself, there’s a pretty even split between design and front-end development. I like doing both; bonus points for them being on the same project. In terms of development, I’m more than happy in HTML & CSS. I know enough JS to get by but I’m no expert. I love Sass. I prefer Grunt to manage by builds, GitHub for managing source control and Jekyll for powering simple sites. I have experience with several CMS and E-commerce platforms. On the design side, I have plenty of experience with the Adobe Creative Suite and more recently, have been using Sketch almost exclusively. Almost — most of you may know I’m quite the fan of subtle details and textures that just aren’t possible in Sketch yet so I still jump into Photoshop to create those, even for just importing back into Sketch. Flat design is mostly just lazy. I little depth goes a long way!

And now to break the unspoken rule of the web... telling people my rates! I know it seems to be taboo within the community to let people know what you charge, instead asking clients how much they're prepared to spend. I like to be more transparent than that. I charge £25 GBP per hour and take minimum bookings of one day. Given an eight hour work day, that equates to £200 GBP. For day bookings, I invoice for the full amount up front and for any more, a 50% deposit up front and the rest upon completion. There, wasn’t so difficult to put out there, was it?

So, if you’re looking for a designer and/or front-end developer and I fit the bill, I would love to hear from you. You can [view my portfolio](http://dave.mn "View My Portfolio") for work samples and a CV, including contact information if you’d like to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from and possibly working with you!
