Caught from Peg 2 on the middle rod at Angel Lakes at 21:54. Fished over to far bank with a Grange and half a Milky Toffee combo. Standard knotless knot hair rig. This is the fish now known as Olivia as was actually [my first French carp]({{ site.url }}/carp-001 "My first French Carp") back in 2009 at 41lb so it was nice to see the growth!
