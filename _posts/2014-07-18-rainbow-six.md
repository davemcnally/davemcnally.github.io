It’s been a while since I’ve looked forward to any kind of shooter but this is looking more and more impressive each day. Granted, this situation was clearly scripted and acted out and we know people in general don’t talk, act and play like this online.

But what if they did? Forget about playing with random people, get yourself a good group of friends together and let the teamwork speak for itself. I think this game is going to something special for those who put in the effort.
